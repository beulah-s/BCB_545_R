```
You have inspected the data thoroughly. The code ran without any interuption in my computer. 
You have explained each step and took necessary caution before each step to check the data format and use the right code. 
The codes are precise and without redundancy. 
In data visualization, the step to make sure the numbers were in order is great!
You did a good job analyzing the data by looking at the graphs as well.
Your choice to look at the GC content is relevant and might help understand the correlation between GC content and occurence of SNPs in the groups.

Overall you have done a great job with the codes and explained each step clearly, and also generated colourful and well labeled plots.
